# Stage 2 - Scripts

> Let's make it easier

In the package.json file you will see scripts that run the commands we need to start and stop our docker containers.

Just below there is a ```scriptsComment``` section.  This is a simple trick to embed comments into a package.json
file will respecting the limits of this file format. Each of the commands in the scripts section
has a comment that explains what it does.  See package.json for the source of truth.  Here is what these sections looked like
at one stage of development, for example only.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "docs:dev": "vuepress dev docs",
    "docs:build": "vuepress build docs",
    "client:start": "cd client/my-project && npm run serve",
    "client:build": "cd client/my-project && npm run build",
    "docked:start": "docker-compose -f stage2-docker-compose.yml up --build",
    "docked:stop": "docker-compose -f stage2-docker-compose.yml down",
    "docked:on:prod:start": "docker-compose -f stage2-docker-compose.yml -f stage2-prod-docker-compose.yml up --build",
    "docked:on:prod:stop": "docker-compose -f stage2-docker-compose.yml -f stage2-prod-docker-compose.yml down",
    "docked:full:start": "npm run client:build && npm run docked:start",
    "docked:full:on:prod:start": "npm run client:build && npm run docked:on:prod:start"
  },
  "scriptsComments": {
    "docs:dev": "Start the vuepress doc server",
    "docs:build": "Build the vuepress doc files",
    "client:start": "Start the client in dev HRM mode. Inject address to api server. Match port to what is in docker compose file",
    "client:build": "Compile client into static site. Inject address to api server. Match port to what is in docker compose file",
    "client:build:on:prod": "Ditto but with production domain",
    "docked:start": "Start the docker containers. Connections: client http://localhost port spec'd in compose file (8083)",
    "docked:on:prod:start": "Start docker containers like and for the prod server. Can use on dev box. Connections: client http://(localhost/domain) port 80.",
    "docked:full:start": "Ditto but first build the static client side.",
    "docked:full:on:prod:start": "Ditto but first build the static client side."
  }
}
``` 

With these in place one only needs to run the much simpler ``npm run script``.  For example
``` 
npm run docked:full:on:prod:start
```
is the command to use on your production server. One line rebuilds the static web site and starts the nginx web server.
Run the stop command ```npm run docked:on:prod:stop``` to stop the web server.

Suggestion: add a command that does both; stop and then start; and call it refresh.

## Workshop Instructions
Try out the start and stop scripts and verify you can see the web site working.
Ideally do this on both your dev and prod machines.
